No installation required. The R scripts can be run from any R console.

find-solution.R contains the function find.solution() that can be added to your code to help solve your NSP, see in code comments for details.

find-solution-test.R contains a very similar function that is used for testing purposes or when more information in the output is desired. (Also returns times taken).

generate-test-data.R can be adjusted and run to create example input data.

generate-examples.R can be used to analyse outputs of the function found in find-solution-test.R

Happy optimising!
